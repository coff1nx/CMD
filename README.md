CmdPlus is a Windows-only GUI application built with PyQt6.

It provides:
- Shell command execution
- Real Windows CMD session (via native pipes)
- Project history launcher
- Non-blocking threaded execution
- Proper handling of Windows console encodings

Security note:
This application does NOT log keystrokes, collect data, or transmit information.
The global hotkey feature is optional and only toggles window visibility.
